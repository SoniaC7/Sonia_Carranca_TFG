The main folder detective-game contains all folders necessary to run the game. However, it will be necessary to install Vuex and Vuetify to run it without problem. At the end there are guides to install both plugins. Because the installation was done with NPM, inside /src folder there is a /node_modules folder created which is very large. 
The /src folder contains all the code developed and 2 folders created by Vuex which are /router and /store.
